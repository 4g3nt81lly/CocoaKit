# CocoaKit
An extension package that enhances your macOS application/API development experience with Cocoa.

## 🧐&ensp;Motivation
Being a macOS application developer, I often find myself not satisfied with the utility native Swift language and Cocoa API provide. There will always be features for which the native Swift language or Cocoa API does not readily support that are common among application/API development. So, I developed this package in hoping to resolve this issue, incorporating some of the features and properties of the Python programming language.

## 🤔&ensp;Why use it?
> _Time is money._&ensp;--Benjamin Franklin

Using this package will drastically reduce the time spent on implementing some of the basic features of an application. Inspired by Python, this package also helps save your time by offering numerous handy extension methods that will make your programming life much easier, especially for developing APIs!

You can save a lot of time just by adding this package to your project. How neat! 😎

## 🧩&ensp;Features
